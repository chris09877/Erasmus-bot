Democracyhas never been more celebrated and under threat at the same time. It has been heralded as the best way of making political decisions, but it is also vulnerable to many challenges, chief among which are citizen dissatisfaction, policy short-termism, polarization and misinformation. That is why it iscrucial for current and future decisionmakers, andengaged citizensalike, to critically assess the main challenges to democracy, and to acquire the foresight tools necessary for improving democratic governance futures.

advantages
We put maximum effort intoblended education, a combination of online classes and classes on campus. This way, students don't necessarily have to be on campus if they don't need to, but we also believe in the added value of physical teaching moments. Usually classes are taught for a few hours spread over one semester or one academic year. If there is mandatory attendance for a particular course, it will be clearly communicated in advance. You can always view theclass schedulesfor the current academic year. In the class schedule you can find out whether a course is online, on-campus or via lecture recordings. If a course does not appear in the timetable, it can be followed via recordings. The best way to view the schedule is on a course-by-course basis. That way you can estimate whether it can be combined.
